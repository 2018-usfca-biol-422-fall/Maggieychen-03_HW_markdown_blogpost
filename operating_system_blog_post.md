# Comparing Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems.

This is a brief introduction of Windows, MacOS, and Linus operating systems. Facing the general public and students who want to learn some basic information about all 3 operating systems.

## Windows system

### History about Windows system.
Windows was introduced in 1985. *Windows 1.0* was a remarkable system that allows users to point and to click, instead of using command to communicate with computer. This feature is also referred as the *graphical user interface (GUI)*. Later Microsoft kept updating the Windows systems, after 30 years of development, there are a lot of remarkable features and versions has been released. So far there are total 12 versions been released, here are some of the versions:
* *Windows XP(2001)*, one of the Microsoft's best-selling products, which offers Home and Professional versions of the system. It also support the connection to wireless network.
* *Windows Vista(2006)*, an updated version of Windows XP, that can detect hardware issue before it occurs, better security protection and more responsive operation.
* *Windows 8(2012)*, a completely redesigned operating system for touchscreen use. This operating system also shorted the staring time from minutes to seconds.

* Now the newest version is *Windows 10(2015)*, which made any qualified device can upgrade to it, like tables, PC, smartphones), which Windows 8 only support x86PCs and ARM processors.

Microsoft has also developed Windows system for servers and Mobile Devices, like *Windows Home Sever(2007)*, *Windows Phone (2010)*, etc.


### Pros and Cons of Windows

There are many advantages of Windows system, which made it the mostly widely used system nowadays, according to the Market Share Statistics for Internet Technologies at 2017.

* **Easy to use.** The standardized presentation of Windows systems has made it user friendly. Windows has kept the how the programs are written and how the file system present pretty consistent throughout different versions.

* **Software Compatibility.** There is a wild rage of applications are available for Windows. There are even a good amount to softwares that are only available to Windows, like softwares for certain business use. For the most of the programs that is available for Windows, if the user update the systems, those programs will also work for the new version. In this way, users don't need to worry too much about loosing the data, while upgrading the system.

There are also several downside of the Windows system.

* **Closed Source.** Only Microsoft has the full access to the software's source code. This makes personalizing the software and troubleshooting problems harder or less flexible.

* **Poor Security.** Windows are easier to be hijacked compare to other operating system. Due to the closed source, there is no log file generated in Windows system, which makes it hard to prove other's involvement, and lead to the compromisation of hijacking activities.

## MacOS system

## History about MacOS

MacOS is the a series of *graphical user interface (GUI)* developed and released by Apple since 2001. The old name of MacOS are "Mac OS X" and "OS X". macOS used UNIX as basis operating system. Before the macOS series, the "classic" MacOS was introduced 1984, and released to the version of *Mac OS 9* until 1999. Throughout 1990s, the development of the "classic" MacOS wasn't as successful as it was expected. Then at 1996, Apple brought NeXT and use it OPENSTEP (a *object-oriented application programming interface-API*) as the basic of Apple's operating system, which was developed by Steven Jobs. The first release of Mac OS X was *Mac OS X 10.0* at March 2001. The name of "Mac OS X" was used until 2012, and it's versions are named after big cats, like *Mac OS X 10.1 Puma*, *Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar*. Then, since the release of *OS X 10.9 Mavericks*, landmarks of California became the names of different versions of Mac OS X. Starting with *macOS 10.12 Sierra*, "macOS" has been adopt as the operating system name. So far, there are 15 version as been released, the newest version is the *macOS 10.14 Mojave(2018)*.

## Pros and Cons about MacOS

### Advantages
* **Simple and Efficient user Interface.** Both MacOS and Windows has a user friendly *graphical user interface (GUI)*. MacOS provides a more efficient operation experience for it users. For example, installing, and deleting can be done in the same way with iOS system. MacOS is open source, so users can personalize their app and computer to reach the best efficiency. Also iCloud and airdrop are very convenient for synchronize files from iPhone, iPads to MacBook.

* **Better Security.** Compare to other operating system, like Windows, MacOS do has a better security and less virus, which don't request users to manage the virus or the security issues as much as Windows Users.

* **Multitasking Feature.** MacOS has build in short-cut keys and trackpad gestures to help user switch in between of windows and tasks faster and smoother. It also allow user to operate on two windows at the same time use the split screen.

### Disadvantages
* **Cost.** Mac computers are relatively more expensive compare to other brands. It is easier and cheaper to by a computer with Windows than a Mac computer.

* **Software Incompatibility.** Comparing with Windows user, there are a lot of softwares that does not support MacOS system. When using MacOS for business and professional uses, figuring out a alternative app can be very time consuming and difficult.   

## Linux system

### History about Linux

Linux was developed first by Linus Torvalds in 1991. The operating system was completed when combined (became) with Linux kernel Project. Linux also know as GNU, this is because when the system is completed with members of the *Free Software Foundation* for the GNU Project. GNU project is a collaborative project for development of free softwares. MINIX, a Unix-like system for academic use has been released at 1985 with the source code available. Torvald's work of development was done on MINIX. Linux is known as a operating system with *graphical user interface (GUI)*, and massive amount of tools, as well as available applications. Linux is also well know with it open source, that everyone can build on it.

## Pros and Cons about Linux

### Advantages
* **Free Tools and Applications.** Due the development of Linux has collaborated with the *Free Software Foundation*, there are a lot of applications and tool, even commercial applications are free to Linux system. Linus also come with a range of open source applications.

* **Open Source.** The open source of Linux allow programmer to collaborate on different project, and the code for the Linux got reviewed a lot by programmers, thus, is constantly improving. Open source applications allow user to modify it by their specific uses. This also make the Linux system easy to manage, which makes it very secured.

### Disadvantages
* **Application Incompatibility.** For Linux system, the issue of application on different versions and on different distribution exist. Sometimes, one application is not compatible on different versions of same distribution, according the article of 'What Is Linux?'.

* **Business applications.** Windows is known for available for a wide rage of application and tools for business use. However, for Linux, there are not much business applications for it. Thus, when choosing an operating system for business usage, user might want to make sure the application is available for linux system.
